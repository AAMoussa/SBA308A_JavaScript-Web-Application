  Accomplishments:
  ----------------
1-  I created a simple small single-webpage that upon loading, it makes a fetch/request to the Cat API.
2-  First, I created the HTML/CSS document/sheet to structure/style the web page.
3-  The header is clickable and interactive to reload a new set of cat pictures to be displayed in the body.

    itirates over each cat object, assign it to a newly created image element and push it to div element seen as the gallery.
